                    <p> My name is Sergey Maguire, I am twenty-one years old and have lived in California for seventeen and a
                        half years, I originally was born in Moscow, Russia. I have four siblings two brothers and two sisters.
                        One of my brothers even has the same name as me and both of them are from Russia also. Currently
                        I am working to become an electrician but decided to change careers and do computer programming.
                        I am new to this field but am excited to learn and have real world pratice and experience. I am excited
                        for this class and look foward to graduating and learning all I can, and use the right tools for
                        programming.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The picture shows me fishing for large mouth bass at El Capitan, I fish there quite often and go to San
                        Vincente also. I have been fishing ever since I was a little kid and also take trips to Montana and
                        Central California. There I fish for trout and recently caught a eight pound rainbow trout which
                        is extremely large for fly fishing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also like to ride motorcyles. It is the second most dangerous sport besides jockey racing. I have a
                        2018 XSR 900 which is a very fast and fun bike.</p>
