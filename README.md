# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This is a rough draft portfolio of me!  This was one of my first programming projects that I accomplished using Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML.  This is just a static page the only actions that can be done are switching pages from the contact page to the about page...  Down below is a link to view my portfolio.  This was my first practical and worthy use of HTML and CSS I used a lot of margins to position a lot of my content which I wished I had not done at the time.
